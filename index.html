        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Illustrator 2. This class is meant to serve as a continuation of what you learned in Illustrator 1 and a guide to creating advanced artwork in Illustrator.</p>

        <h2>About This Class</h2>

        <p>This manual serves two main purposes</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The exercises will give you step-by-step instructions in creating a poster that utilize many of the tools offered in Illustrator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The manual serves as a means to familiarize yourself with some of the intermediate and advanced tools in Adobe Illustrator. This class will also review key tools and concepts from Illustrator 1. The topics we will be covering include using Layers, working with color, adding and editing text, drawing with the Curvature Tool, editing strokes, exploring Illustrator effects, exploring the Appearance Panel, using patterns, and exporting your final project.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>This class requires a basic familiarity with the Windows or Macintosh operating system and previous attendance of Illustrator 1 or equivalent experience.</p>

        <h2>Other Requirements</h2>

        <p>This class requires the Illustrator 2 class files folder provided by STS, as well as a computer with Adobe Illustrator. The project was created with Illustrator CC 2020, but you will be able to complete the project with other versions of Illustrator as well.</p>

        <h2>Poster Project</h2>

        <p>In today's workshop, we will create a poster to advertise for an ice cream social at Memorial Union. In addition to exploring intermediate and advanced tools in Illustrator, we will learn about utilizing basic design principles to convey our message in a aethetically pleasing manner.</p>

        <p>Before you begin any design, it is important to understand what message you want to convey. Our goal is for students to want to come to this event and feel like they will have a great time there. Thus, we will focus on creating a joyful and inviting mood while informing students about the event through a simple design. This sets the tone for our design, the choice of colors, and the typography.</p>

        <h1>Illustrator 2 Practice File</h1>

        <p>For the first half of the class, we will learn about the Curvature Tool and create a few components of the poster. </p>

        <p>Begin by downloading the Class Files "Illustrator2-Practice-2020" and then from Illustrator going to <strong class="highlight">File > Open</strong> and select <strong>Illustrator2-Practice-2020</strong></p>

        <h2>Setting up the Workspace</h2>

        <p>The Workspace layout determines what panels and options are available to you in your Illustrator interface. We will be using the <strong>Essentials</strong> layout in the class. To switch Workspace layouts, navigate to the Menu Bar and choose <strong class="highlight"> Window > Workspace > Essentials</strong>

            <div class="important center">
                <h2>Control Panel Not Appearing?</h2>
                <p>As of Illustrator 2020, the <strong>Control Panel is off by default</strong>.</p>
                <p> To enable this feature for easier access to alignment and fill/stroke tools, go to <strong class="highlight">Window > Control</strong></p>
                <p>However, it should be noted that all of the extra tools the Control Panel offers can be found in the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> next to the Layers Panel. Like the Control Panel, the Properties Panel will change features according to the Tool you're selected on.</p>
            </div>

    </section>

    <section class="topic">
        <h1>Layers Panel</h1>

        <p>We will explore one of the most important organizing tools in Adobe Illustrator: layers. Using the Layers Panel not only helps you to organize your work, but it also allows others to easily navigate through your project when sharing files.</p>

        <p>A project is often seperated into different components called layers. A single layer is conceptually a transparent sheet, allowing you to add content to as many layers as you would like, while being able to see the content on other layers as well. You can reorder and rename layers, hide them, or lock them to aid workflow on your project.</p>


        <h3>Renaming Layers</h3>
        <p>To change the title of the layer, double-click on the title and rename the layer.</p>

        <h3>Visibility</h3>
        <div class="float-left">
            <img src="images/icon-eye.png" alt="The eye icon in the Layers Panel">
        </div>

        <p>The two boxes to the left of each layer name indicate visibility and locking of the layers. Clicking in the first of the two boxes toggles the visibility of a layer with the eye icon. This is useful when you want to focus on specific layers without being distracted by others.</p>


        <h3>Locking Layers</h3>
        <div class="float-left">
            <img src="images/icon-lock.png" alt="The lock icon in the Layers Panel">
        </div>

        <p>Clicking in the second of the two boxes locks or unlocks a layer with the lock icon. When you lock a layer, you are unable to make any changes to that layer. It is useful to lock layers that you want to leave unadjusted, such as the background, while you work on the rest of your document.</p>

        <h3> Creating and Deleting New Layers </h3>

        <div class="float-left">
            <img src="images/icon-addlayer.png" alt="The plus icon for adding layers within the Layers Panel">
        </div>

        <p>In the lower left hand corner, select the plus icon to create a new layer and click the trash icon to delete the selected layer. </p>

        <h2>Practice Layer</h2>

        <p>Since this practice file has multiple layers, we want to work within the 'Practice' layer in order for the tools to work properly.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <strong>Layers Panel</strong> and select the 'Practice' layer.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/practicelayer.png" alt="Layers Panel with the layer 'Practice Layer' selected">

        </ol>

        <h2>Pizza Toppings</h2>

        <p>In this exercise, we will learn about how the order of layers affect the project's appearance. Let's organize our layers so the toppings show up on the pizza.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>In the Layers Panel, click and drag the 'Toppings' layer above the 'Pizza' layer.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/pizza-1.gif" alt="GIF of the Layers Panel, moving the 'Toppings' layer above the 'Pizza' layer  ">

            <p>Goodbye cheese pizza and hello supreme!</p>

        <h1>Curvature Tool</h1>

        <p>The Curvature Tool is similar to the Pen Tool; however, it specializes in making curved lines. We will learn more about this tool in the following exercises.</p>

        <div class="reference">
            <h2>Curvature Tool</h2>

        ` <h1>Hair Exercise</h1>

        <p>Time to create the students for our poster! We will draw various hair styles for the students with the Curvature Tool.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>For student 1, the shape is very similar to the leaf exercise, but there is a slight difference. In this case, only double-click on the point near the ear because that is the only corner in this shape.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/student1-1.gif" alt="GIF showing how to complete the leaf shaped hair section with five points using the Curvature Tool">

            <li>
                <p>First, make sure the shape is selected. We are going to use a shortcut to select the <strong>Eyedropper Tool.</strong> Click on the <kbd>i</kbd> key to activate the <strong>Eyedropper Tool</strong> then click on the eyebrow to sample the brown color.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Set the Fill to none and choose a Stroke Color because this will help us see the dotted template while we draw the shapes. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Moving onto student 2, start from one of the corners and begin drawing the right hair part. Note that there are only two instances where we will need to double-click while drawing the shape.</p>

        <h1>Getting Started on the Poster</h1>

        <p>To start, we need to create a new Illustrator document and set up our Workspace.</p>

        <h3>Creating a New Document</h3>

        <p>For our poster, we want to print it on a standard US letter, so we need to take bleed into account. Bleed is a border that extends beyond the artboard. Anything located between the edge of the artboard and the red-colored border will be cut out of the final printed product. This guide ensures that all of the artwork will remain on the page after printing and trimming our project. A 0.125 inch bleed is considered industry standard, but this can vary depending on the guidelines of the project. </p>

        <h2>Making Guides</h2>

        <p>Guides appear as light blue lines on the artboard and we will use them to mark where we want to place certain objects on our poster. This will help give us an idea of the layout for our poster, so we will use Guides to create a rough template.</p>

        <h1>Arranging Ice Cream Scoops</h1>

        <p>We will focus on creating colorful ice cream for our poster, and they will also act as the body for our ice cream people. In addition, we will introduce sublayers as a way to further organize a project without creating additonal layers.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

    <section class="topic">
        <h1>Creating the Students</h1>

        <p>Our next step is to create the students in the poster. We will include the faces we made earlier, and we will also create the arms by editing the Stroke properties and using the Width Tool. </p>

        <h2>Adding the Faces</h2>
        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Create a new layer and name it 'People'.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/people-layer.png" alt="Layers Panel with the 'People' layer selected">

            <li>
                <p>Go back to the Practice File (from the Class Files we downloaded) and click on the lock icon for the 'Unlocked Exercise' layer. This layer contains the faces, and we will need unlock the layer in order to copy it.</p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <p>Before we copy the faces, we want to group the shapes together for each face so that it makes it easier to arrange them on the poster later. Use the rubberband method to select one of the faces using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, right-click and select <strong>Group</strong>. Repeat for the other faces.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/face-1.png" alt="First face selected, right-clicked on to open menu.'Group' is selected from the menu">

            <li>
                <p>Use the rubber band method to select all the faces. Copy then paste them into the Ice Cream Poster.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/face-3.png" alt="Four faces positioned next to the Waffle graphic and artboard with blue rectangle background and ice cream cone with four scoops">

            <li>
                <p>For the faces, place them on top of the ice cream scoops. To add a little variety, rotate the faces on the chocolate scoop and the vanilla scoop to the left and right respectively; however, keep the angle small. Arranging these two faces in opposite directions keeps the poster looking balanced while adding interest.</p>

            </li>

        <h2>Editing Stroke Properties for the Arms</h2>

        <h3>Stroke Caps</h3>
        <p>One of the stroke properies we will look at is Stoke Caps. They define the shape at the ends of any stroke, and we will use this to apply rounded strokes for the arms.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>First, use the <strong>Eyedropper Tool </strong>to sample D1.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Properties Panel, click on the word "Stroke". From the panel, change the Weight to 25pt and click on the Round Cap (the second icon of the three options).</p>
            </li>

        <h3>Drawing the Arms</h3>
        <h4>Strawberry Scoop</h4>
        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Before you begin, make sure you are editing within the 'People' layer.</p>

            <li>
                <p>For the Strawberry Scoop, use the Curvature Tool to draw two curved lines, as if the student is raising their arms in joy. To end the stroke for each arm, use the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <h4>Vanilla & Chocolate Scoop</h4>

        <p> Instead of drawing raised arms for these two scoops, we will only focus on drawing one arm. This prevents the design from becoming being too overwhelming with visuals.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Let's start on the vanilla scoop. Click on D2 with the <strong>Eyedropper Tool</strong> to select the color.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Use the <strong>Curvature Tool</strong> to draw a curved raised arm to the right of the face. </p>

            <li>
                <p>In a similar fashion, use the <strong>Eyedropper Tool</strong> to select D3. Create another curved line to the left of the face to form the raised arm for the chocolate scoop.</p>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Mint Scoop</h4>

        <p>The center of the poster already features a lot of images, so we want to avoid adding any more objects in that area. Thus, we will create a lowered arm for the mint scoop.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>With the <strong>Eyedropper Tool</strong>, click on D4.</p>

            <li>
                <p>On the left side of the face, draw an arm that curves to the right.</p>

        </ol>

        <h3>Width Tool</h3>
        <p>In order to make our arms a little more organic, we will use the Width Tool to widen certain areas of the Stroke. </p>

        <p>Now that we are done with the vector graphics, we will look at typography in the following exercises.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="topic">

        <h1>Working with Type</h1>

        <p>We will review components of the Type Tool, learn about tracking and leading, and introduce the Type on a Path Tool.</p>

        <h2>Creating Type with the Ellipse Tool</h2>
        <p>The guides create a box on the upperhalf of the arboard, and this is the designated spot for our title. To create the title, we will use the Ellipse Tool to create curved text then we will adjust the font, font size, and tracking. </p>

        <div class="reference">
            <h2>Type on a Path Tool</h2>
            <img src="images/typeonapath-tool.png" alt="Type of a Path Tool Icon from the Tools Panel">

            <p>The Type on a Path Tool creates type along a path. A path can be created by the Shape Tools, the Pen Tool, and the Curvature Tool. The text can flow along the edge of an open or a closed path.</p>

            <p>After creating a path, select the Type on a Path Tool. Click on the path and start typing.</p>

            <p>If you cannot find the Type on a Path Tool from the Tools Panel, it's most likely hidden under the Type Tool. Click and hold on the Type Tool to reveal more tools and choose the "Type on a Path Tool"</p>

        </div>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Create a new layer and name it "Title"</p>

            <li>
                <p>In the Tools Panel, set the Fill and Stroke Color to none.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/title-1.png" alt="Close-up of Fill and Stroke Color icon with both set to 'none' (white background with red diagonal line)">

            <li>
                <p>Select the <strong>Ellipse Tool</strong> then click once and enter 18.7 inches for the width and 11.6 inches for the height. Since there is no Fill or Stroke, click on the outline of the ellipse to move it. Position it so the ellipse is centered and covers half of the upper box that is created by the guides. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Click and hold on the <strong>Type Tool</strong> to select the <strong>Type on a Path Tool</strong>. This will allow us to type on the ellipse so the text appears curved. Click on the outline of the ellipse and type "ICE CREAM". Next, highlight the text.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/title-4.png" alt="Character Panel close-up with font 'ヒラギノ角ゴ StdN W8' selected and size 62pt">

            <li>
                <p>Next, we will begin by looking at tracking. <strong>Tracking</strong> controls the space between characters in an entire block of text. Tracking and kerning are typographic terms that have to do with the space between characters. The default tracking settings for body text are usually adequate, but larger display text can often be adjusted for presentation purposes. Play around with this, but we will not be adjusting the tracking for the title.</p>

            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/title-5.png" alt="'ICE CREAM written on a path in black. Font is thicker than before.">

            <li>
                <p>For most of our text, we will be applying a pale yellow for the text color. Use the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> to select the title then use the <strong>Eyedropper Tool</strong> and click on the color E1.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/title-6.png" alt="'ICE CREAM written on a path in cream color (swatch E9)">

        </ol>

        <h2>Drop Shadow</h2>
        <p>The base of our text is done, but we will add a drop shadow effect to bring more attention to the title. </p>

        <h2>Finishing the Title</h2>
        <p>The title is missing one last line of text, but instead of applying all the same effects and properties, we will create a copy of the newly created "ICE CREAM" text and change the content.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, select "ICE CREAM" then create a copy. </p>

            <li>
                <p>Click on the <strong>Type Tool</strong> and replace the text with "SOCIAL". Move the text until it is between the "C" from "ICE" and the "M" from "ICE CREAM". </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Lastly, lock the 'Title' layer.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/social-2.png" alt="'ICE CREAM SOCIAL' title in cream color. 'SOCIAL' is directly under 'ICE CREAM'">

        </ol>

        <h2>Informational Text</h2>
        <p>It is time to add more information to the poster so people will know more about this event. We will utilize the guides to help us position the text. Futhermore, we will learn about leading.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Create a new layer and name it 'Text'</p>

            <li>
                <p>Using the <strong>Type Tool,</strong> create a text box starting from the guide intersection at 1.25 and 8.25 inches to the 7.5 and 10 inch intersection. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Let's take a look at leading. <strong>Leading</strong> controls the white space between lines of text. This can be useful when you want to delinieate information more clearly if it occurs on several lines of text. With the text highlighted, go to the Properties Panel and play around with the leading. Note that we will not be applying any of those adjustments to the text, but if you like how it looks, you can keep your edits.</p>

            <li>
                <p>To help the text stand out, we will create a darker teal box in the background. Make a new layer and name it 'Rectangle'. Move the layer so it is beneath the Text layer.</p>

        <h1>Cleaning Up the Poster</h1>

        <p>For the finishing touches, we will delete the parts of the shapes that extend beyond the artboard.</p>

        <h2>Finishing the Cone</h2>

        <p>We are going to delete the portion of the cone below the informational text box by using the Shape Builder Tool.</p>

        <h1>Accessiblity</h1>

        <p>An important aspect of graphic design is making the product accessible. Certain color combininations work well universally like blue and orange, but other color combinations make it difficult for someone with color blindness to differentiate the colors. One great tool in Illustrator is the ability to view your project through the eyes of someone with colorblindness. This helps you make adjustments to the project in order to make it more visually accessible.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>There are 3 types of colorblindness: red-green, blue-yellow, and complete colorblindness. Under these three categories, people's decreased sensitivity to certain colors can vary in severity. Illustrator allows users to view the project through the eyes of someone with protanopia and deuteranopia.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Menu Bar, go to <strong class="highlight">View > Proof Setup > Color blindness - Protanopia-type</strong></p>

            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/protanopia-1.png" alt="View menu expanded with 'Proof Setup' and 'Color blindness - Protanopia-type' selected">

            <li>
                <p>People with protanopia have decreased sensitivity to red light. Looking at the colors, the text and the illustration still pop out from the poster, and a key factor behind this is contrast. Contrast is the difference between the lightness and darkness of colors. For example, there is a high contrast between the dark rectangle and the light yellow informational text. By having different levels of contrast, it helps draw attention to certain elements and defines shapes from each other. </p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/protanopia-2.png" alt="Poster previewed in Color blindness setting Protanopia. Colors highlighted are blue and yellow">

            <li>
                <p>In a similar fashion, go to <strong class="highlight">View > Proof Setup > Color blindness - Deuteranopia-type</strong></p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/deuteranopia-1.png" alt="View menu expanded with 'Proof Setup' and 'Color blindness - Deuteranopia-type' selected">

            <li>
                <p>People with deuteranopia have decreased sensitivity to green light. In this example, the text and the graphics still draw attention due to its high contrast. A good way to increase visibility is to add a drop shadow to the text, as shown with the drop shadow around the light yellow title.</p>
            </li>

            <img class="center" src="images/deuteranopia-2.png" alt="Poster previewed in Color blindness setting Deuteranopia.">

        </ol>

        <p>For any project in Illustrator, it is always a good idea to take a quick look at the protanopia and deuteranopia viewing modes before finalizing your project so you can make adjustments to color and contrast. Even beyond this class, we would recommend researching and applying a color blind friendly pallete for other projects With the poster completed, we are ready to move on to exporting!</p>
